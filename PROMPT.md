I’m working on my **polyglot e-commerce microservices project** to learn **Go, DevOps, and strengthen my Java backend skills**.  

- **Services:** Java (User, Order), Go (Product, Payment, Cart, Notification).  
- **Tech stack:** Go, Java Spring Boot, Docker, Kubernetes, Tilt, Terraform, GitHub Actions, PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka/RabbitMQ, Prometheus, Grafana, ELK/Loki.  
- **Workflow:** Start small with Go Product Service → Add Java Order Service → Event-driven messaging → Tilt for local dev → Kubernetes deployment → Monitoring/Logging → CI/CD → Terraform infra.  
- **Goal:** Learn Go & DevOps while growing as a Java backend developer, and build a portfolio-ready system.  

Please help me continue building from where I left off.
