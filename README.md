# üõí E-Commerce Microservices (Java + Go + DevOps)

This project is a **polyglot e-commerce microservices system** built to learn and practice:
- **Go (Golang) backend development**
- **Java (Spring Boot) backend development**
- **DevOps & Cloud-Native practices** (Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, Tilt, Terraform, Monitoring)

The system simulates a real-world e-commerce platform where services are distributed, containerized, and orchestrated.

## üéØ Goals

- Gain **hands-on experience with Go** by building microservices.
- Strengthen **Java backend expertise** with Spring Boot.
- Practice **DevOps workflows**: containers, orchestration, infrastructure as code, CI/CD, monitoring, and observability.
- Learn to integrate **polyglot microservices** (Go + Java) into one ecosystem.
- Build a **portfolio project** that demonstrates backend + DevOps skills.
